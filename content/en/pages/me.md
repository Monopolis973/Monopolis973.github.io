<!-- I'm Spencer Hill, although that doesn't tell you much. I will introduce myself in a moment, but first we should have a quick discussion about the internet, growth, and identity, or none of what follows will seem reasonable at all.

The internet, in my mind, has three large positives:
1. Long distance connections with other people, so you can meet cool folks and have good conversations with them
2. Easy access to massive amounts of information, so you can learn and grow really fast and consistently
3. [i know i had something here, but i dont remember what :( ]

On the other hand, it also has many downsides, including:
1. Long distance connections with other people, allowing you to build your own echo chambers and radicalize your own beliefs without any real opposition
2. Easy access to massive amounts of information, leading to many instances of false information and confirmation bias
3. [i know i had something here, but i dont remember what :( ]

I want to use this website to maximize the positives and minimize the negatives (reasonable, right?), and that means laying a few ground rules. -->

I believe we are all some strange mix of the stories we tell ourselves and how others write you into their own stories. So here are some stories I tell myself:
- I enjoy (and am fairly good at) maths.
- I like DMing goofy D&D campaigns.
- I love music, especially a cappella.
- Thinking philosophically is how I feel real<!--, although my appreciation for technical philosophy has taken a sharp downward turn in the past few months-->.
- Walking helps me think.
- The beach is best at night under a full moon.
- One-on-ones are some of the most illuminating discussions.
- I like to play ultimate frisbee and pickleball, which are both real sports.
- I don't drink many caffinated beverages.
- There is value in religion, even though I no longer believe.
- Changing my mind is an improvement, not a failure.
- I quit playing Minecraft and Magic: the Gathering after graduating high school.
- Love is elusive and omnipresent.<!-- - Brandon Sanderson writes good books. -->
- Politicking is important but scary.
- Life is more than logic.
- The best work is play.
- And the point is **_stories_**.
