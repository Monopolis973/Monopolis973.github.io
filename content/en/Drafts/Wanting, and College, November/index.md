I have one and only one goal for this quarter: learn how to learn, how to grow, how to change, how to be wrong.
Steps I'm going to take to achieve this goal:
- attempt self study, skipping lectures in 111 and 118 iff I can read on my own. Then I can go at my own pace, and I will do all of the problems and any thing that catches my attention as I work through them.
- actively try to fail at things. Hopefully this will create quick feedback cycles and I will be able to learn quickly from this. Also is an attempt to get past the wall that I feel I put up whenever somebody is talking one on one to me and explaining something, because I feel like I should be smart enough to just get it so I often hold my comments in when I don't understand, which is bad, and hopefully this will change that.
- make things. This will necessitate failure, and learning on my own terms.
- be very concientious of the value of social interactions. Do I actually want them? are they good for my goals? Perhaps try "do not talk to anyone until after 6 pm, or after 8 hours of work, or something like that."
- talk to people who are smarter than me. do not be afraid of professers! they will probably like me. 
- ask for things I think I shouldn't get. This will hopefully get me used to rejection, and teach me that I can ask for a lot more than I thought I could.
- be as blunt as possible. ask about things if you are not certain.


November Update:
Things have gone, fine.
I am doing very well at understanding my classes; they're not too difficult, but I'm struggling with doing academic things on my own time.
That being said, I have actually started a barbershop group, a D&D group, and sandscape.
So all told, I think I've spent my time fairly well.
Of course it could be better, of course I could be talking more to teachers and experts, of course I could be trying things I expect to fail, of course I could ask for more.
But I'm happy with the progress I've made.

That being said, staying here would be failure.
I want to keep growing at this rate.
Next quarter, I will be taking a ton of classes, so I need to get into the habit of getting things done asap asap.
To do that, I will be more active about leaving activities that I don't care about.
I will come up with questions.
I will continue to just make stuff.
