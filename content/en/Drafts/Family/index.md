When I first got to college, I felt like I missed my friends more than my family, and that was a very strange feeling.
I no longer feel this way.


And what I feel right now is extremely strange. I noticed during 111A that I was feeling depressed, and i started asking myself why, because the lecture wasnt all that interesting. And I realized something about my life here: I don't touch _anyone_. I think over this week so far, I've touched somebody else only a single time, when I shook Peyton's hand after she showed us here studio. That's a huge change from hugging my family every nigh before I go to bed.
