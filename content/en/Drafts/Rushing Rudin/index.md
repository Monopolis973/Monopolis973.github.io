On October 17, 2025, I decided to see how long it would take me to read and do all the problems in Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis, as an expirement to see how "productive" I can actually be. This is how it went.

So, I failed the challenge. I didn't even get through 1 chapter. That's atrocious.
