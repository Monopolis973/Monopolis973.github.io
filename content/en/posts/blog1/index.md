<!-- I am an island; you probably are as well.\
I have never really used social media, as I was brought up with people always telling me how terrible and harmful it is. This is true, to an extent.  -->

Why did I make this website?
Because many of the people I really respect and look up to have personal websites.
And as I think about social media, and what I want out of the internet, I realize more and more that consumer-based corperations handling personal media (instagram, facebook, etc.) is not what I desire.
I quite like the personal website formula: a reflection of self and thoughts in a very self-realized and conscientious manner, not adjusted to fit some corporation's idea of how online communication should work.\
This is my website.\
My space.\
I am God here.\
Thank you for visiting.
