From time to time throughout my life, I have encountered something I have dubbed "the making mindset."
Sometimes it's just one person in a community, sometimes it's the entire community supporting this.
But people with this mindset simply create.
They get an idea, and if they like it, they make it happen.
No ifs or buts.
They just go for it.
And they are some of the most impressive people I've met.

<!-- some names: lachlan, agniv, ellie, mathcamp in general, inji/nadia??, leo, etc -->

Some things that are often true of these people:
* familiar with code
* good at making things with their hands, in all sorts of strange mediums, from welding to pottery to cardboard architecture
* good planners
* have an undeniably eager energy in all that they do

<!-- Some examples of things these people might do:
* make a ton of custom shirts
* found a bunch of different groups/clubs
* host many strange yet fun activities
* play really detailed pranks -->

Most people I've interacted with seem to intuitively idealize this mindset, even if they don't know it.
I certainly fall under that category, not realizing it until I took some time to meditate on who I wanted to become and learning that I really want to have a maker mindset.
Since that time, I've tried to become a lot more conscientious of what I want to make, and turning that desire into a plan and then effort to actually carry it out.
And it's been a lot more successful than I anticipated!
I've started a barbershop group, a D&D group, and (the thing I'm most proud of) a [Socratica node](https://www.socratica.info/) in Santa Barbara, called [sandscape](https://luma.com/user/Sandscape), where I can hopefully spread this making mindset.
And the energy seems self perpetuating.
Every day when I wake up, if I actually made something the previous day (instead of, say, binging Smiling Friends or Hazbin Hotel-- just hypothetically, of course), I feel excited and ready to live my best life.
I feel invigorated by the feeling of accomplishment.
Of having made the world a slightly more interesting place.\
Of having lived.


In any case, I encourage you to notice the next time you have an intriguing idea, and instead of passing it off as just another random thought, write it down, and start coming up with a plan to make it happen.
And I all but garuntee, meaning will follow.
