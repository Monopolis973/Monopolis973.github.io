      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time throughout my life, I have encountered something I have dubbed &amp;ldquo;the making mindset.&amp;rdquo;
Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s just one person in a community, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s the entire community supporting this.
But people with this mindset simply create.
They get an idea, and if they like it, they make it happen.
No ifs or buts.
They just go for it.
And they are some of the most impressive people I&amp;rsquo;ve met.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- I am an island; you probably are as well.\
I have never really used social media, as I was brought up with people always telling me how terrible and harmful it is. This is true, to an extent.  --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I make this website?&lt;br&gt;
Because many of the people I really respect and look up to have personal websites.
And as I think about social media, and what I want out of the internet, I realize more and more that consumer-based corperations handling personal media (instagram, facebook, etc.) is not what I desire.
I quite like the personal website formula: a reflection of self and thoughts in a very self-realized and conscientious manner, not adjusted to fit some corporation&amp;rsquo;s idea of how online communication should and shouldn&amp;rsquo;t work.&lt;br&gt;
This is my website.&lt;br&gt;
My space.&lt;br&gt;
I am God here.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for visiting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
