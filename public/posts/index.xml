      <description>&lt;!-- I am an island; you probably are as well.\
I have never really used social media, as I was brought up with people always telling me how terrible and harmful it is. This is true, to an extent.  --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I make this website?&lt;br&gt;
Because many of the people I really respect and look up to have personal websites.
And as I think about social media, and what I want out of the internet, I realize more and more that consumer-based corperations handling personal media (instagram, facebook, etc.) is not what I desire.
I quite like the personal website formula: a reflection of self and thoughts in a very self-realized and conscientious manner, not adjusted to fit some corporation&amp;rsquo;s idea of how online communication should work.&lt;br&gt;
This is my website.&lt;br&gt;
My space.&lt;br&gt;
I am God here.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for visiting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
