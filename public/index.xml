      <description>&lt;!-- I am an island; you probably are as well.\
I have never really used social media, as I was brought up with people always telling me how terrible and harmful it is. This is true, to an extent.  --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why did I make this website?&lt;br&gt;
Because many of the people I really respect and look up to have personal websites.
And as I think about social media, and what I want out of the internet, I realize more and more that consumer-based corperations handling personal media (instagram, facebook, etc.) is not what I desire.
I quite like the personal website formula: a reflection of self and thoughts in a very self-realized and conscientious manner, not adjusted to fit some corporation&amp;rsquo;s idea of how online communication should work.&lt;br&gt;
This is my website.&lt;br&gt;
My space.&lt;br&gt;
I am God here.&lt;br&gt;
Thank you for visiting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My socks are chalk white.&lt;br&gt;
Mom yells at me, they stand out.&lt;br&gt;
Wear coal black instead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You reach down to pick it up&lt;br&gt;
From underneath the waves, but&lt;br&gt;
Then it is obscured in muck&lt;br&gt;
The dust the sand that you yourself have&lt;br&gt;
Stirred into the water, and so&lt;br&gt;
You must wait patiently&lt;br&gt;
Until the path finally clears,&lt;br&gt;
And then and only then&lt;br&gt;
Can you try again&lt;br&gt;
To reach it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;!-- I&#39;m Spencer Hill, although that doesn&#39;t tell you much. I will introduce myself in a moment, but first we should have a quick discussion about the internet, growth, and identity, or none of what follows will seem reasonable at all.

The internet, in my mind, has three large positives:
1. Long distance connections with other people, so you can meet cool folks and have good conversations with them
2. Easy access to massive amounts of information, so you can learn and grow really fast and consistently
3. [i know i had something here, but i dont remember what :( ]

On the other hand, it also has many downsides, including:
1. Long distance connections with other people, allowing you to build your own echo chambers and radicalize your own beliefs without any real opposition
2. Easy access to massive amounts of information, leading to many instances of false information and confirmation bias
3. [i know i had something here, but i dont remember what :( ]

I want to use this website to maximize the positives and minimize the negatives (reasonable, right?), and that means laying a few ground rules. --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we are all some strange mix of the stories we tell ourselves and how others write you into their own stories. So here are some stories I tell myself:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
